Inference for YOLOv8-based Microplastic Detection
# YOLOv8 Microplastic Detection (Inference Only)

This repository provides an inference script to run a trained **YOLOv8 model** on images for detecting microplastics.  
It loads a custom-trained YOLOv8 model (`best.pt`) and saves predictions with bounding boxes.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Run inference on single images or folders.
- Automatically saves results (with bounding boxes) in the specified folder.
- Compatible with any YOLOv8 model.
